# SolidPractice
This project is to practice SOLID concepts. reference from the book:Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#

There are some sample codes in five folder categories
1. SRP
   rectangle separate  GeometricRectangle and GraphicalRectangle, They all inherited Rectangle.
  GeometricRectangle is responsible for Aera return and GraphicalRectangle is responsible for Drawing the shape(just return width and height here).
2. OCP
  2.1 Use interface Shape to define Draw(), then let Square and Circle to inherit it. When call DrawAllShapes(), we just 
      use interface Shape to define the object list, then call Draw(). In the future, we just need to extend other Object inherited Shape. DrawAllShapes() 
	  can doesnâ€™t need to modify.
  2.2 Test arraylist to sort shapes, but we don't want to modify shape and orther class, so use new Shapecomparer class inherit IComparer, just modify TestClass
  to used, Shape/Circle/Squire class don't need to modified.
4. DIP
   From High Layer objects depend on Low Layer objects reverse become low layer objects depend on high layer, and depend on high layer interface.
  4.1 Button turn on/off lamp. use Button layer define interface SwitchableDevice, then create Lamp class depend on SwitchableDevice. Button class just implement SwitchableDevice. 
  4.2 Regulate depends on I/O Channel to get the temperature then decide Furance engage/disengage. Same as the pervious case.
